### Sandip Trivedi

I really just created this is see what this feature looks like for Github. I saw this a few other people's profile and wanted to play around with it. I can share a bunch of information about myself so this section doesn't look so sparse.

I'm a cofounder and engineering at [Quantierra](http://www.quantierra.com/). It is a real estate technology startup.

My job is working on software and data, currently related to NYC real estate and I get to work on cool projects with real estate and data (e.g. a [project](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/19/upshot/forty-percent-of-manhattans-buildings-could-not-be-built-today.html) with the New York Times). Even though I work in New York City, I live in Brooklyn, NY.

I have other interests in software and data as well. I should list these out, so I'll put this down as a TODO.

I have a [technical](https://www.strivedi.me/) website highlight my interests in software and data and the like. I also have a [professional](https://www.sandiptrivedi.me) and [personal](https://www.trivedisandip.com) as well. There is not much there in all 3 of them. I really built it to experiment with some static site generators and css frameworks.


In terms of connecting with me, feel free to reach out to me on social media. Although, I'm on social media but I don't really post anything much. It is just a good way to connect with me. Also, I want to use these [markdown badges](https://ileriayo.github.io/markdown-badges/). I found them on Github, check out the awesome repo where they are.
